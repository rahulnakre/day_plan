CREDITS !
1) Thanks to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course for teaching me the content
2) Thanks to Dibgerge on github.com for insanely helpful python versions of Andrew Ng's assignments.
A lot of the stuff pertaining to multivariate linear regression comes pretty much directly from him as this
is what I'm used to. Link: https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments
